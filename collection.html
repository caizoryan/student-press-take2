            Early this year, the OCADU campus was adorned with brightly coloured
            posters that featured a doodled character and a snappy headline
            challenging students to work their minds like they work their
            <em>insert program sensitive tool.</em> OCADU was given a 4 million
            dollar grant by the

            aimed at mental health promotion for post-secondary students
            impacted by the pandemic. They plan to do this by offering video
            lessons teaching students about mindfulness and how to practice it,
            In-person and virtual group classes (not mentioned for what exactly)
            and a few other voluntary activities aimed at enhancing individuals'
            well-being.

            This poster campaign was met with mixed reviews which were clear
            from the vandalization of some found around the main campus
            building. I spoke with Aysia, a 3rd-year cross-disciplinary artist
            who took the initiative and put up posters asking students to scan
            the displayed QR code and voice their anonymous opinions through a
            google forums sheet. With her permission and the permission of her
            group members who also worked on this project, have made the
            responses publically available. Below are all of the responses that
            Aysia and her team have gotten about the 'mindful campus' posters.
